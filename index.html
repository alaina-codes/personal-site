                        my path to becoming a software engineer was certainly a
                        bumpy one. starting off as an english teacher, i quickly
                        realized the classroom wasn't for me (i would not have
                        liked the current alaina, who loves all lower case, but
                        we live and we learn). i learned so, so,
                        <em>so</em> much, but more on that in a bit. after
                        leaving the classroom, i became a loan processor. the
                        company i was with created a technology bootcamp of
                        sorts that i was a part of, and the rest is history.

                    <p>
                        i started off in the fin-tech world, but was focused on
                        building internal tools for our engineering teams,
                        allowing them to build and ship code safely and quickly.
                        then, i transitioned into the wonderful world of email
                        marketing, where i am still at today. i started out
                        working on projects that helped users onboard onto a
                        very robust platform, transitioned into a growth team
                        focused on experiments throughout the entire platform to
                        expand understanding in the platform and reduce churn,
                        and now i build internal tools to help technical support
                        work through very challenging problems.

                        reflecting on my time in my classroom with my 12th
                        graders, i will be honest, i was not the world's best
                        teacher, no matter what my coffee mug tells you. but the
                        one thing i did very well was foster relationships with
                        my students and guide them through the next step in
                        their lives after high school. talking with my students
                        and learning about their hopes and dreams and goals and
                        wishes was the best part of any day. now, as an
                        engineer, i use that skill and mentor as many people as
                        i can, especially those who are transitioning into
                        technology in a non-traditional way. diversity, equity,
                        inclusion, and belonging is also a passion of mine. as
                        someone who doesn't always look like what one would
                        picture when thinking "engineer," i care so incredibly
                        much about building diverse teams with even more diverse
                        voices, fighting for equity in the workplace, and trying
                        to foster the most welcoming culture i can to make sure
                        everyone feels comfortable and that they belong.

                        i am originally from toledo, ohio. i know, i know, ohio
                        is the butt of a lot of jokes, but give me five minutes
                        to talk to you about cincinnati (go bearcats!) and i
                        think i'll change your mind. i moved to detroit after
                        college to teach and have stayed in the mitten ever
                        since. my fiancé and i are now building our dream house
                        in ann arbor (go blue, etc. etc.). if i'm not building
                        stuff and things, i am collecting another cookbook,
                        scrolling through tiktok, obsessing over my perfect cat,
                        and trying to convince my fiancé to learn how to play
                        pickleball.
