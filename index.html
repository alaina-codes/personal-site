                    <p>
                        my career hasn’t been linear (and i kind of like it that way). i started off teaching high school english in detroit, where i learned how much i love learning and how important it is to help others grow. from there, i moved into financial services as a loan processor, handling the process with the kind of precision i didn’t know i had. that role gave me my first taste of the tech world through an internal bootcamp and i never looked back. as a software engineer, i’ve built tools, dashboards, and reporting systems that turn messy, complicated data into something clear and useful. i like figuring out how systems work, spotting patterns, and finding better, faster, and simpler ways to get things done.

                        reflecting on my time in my classroom with my 12th
                        graders, i will be honest, i was not the world's best
                        teacher, no matter what my coffee mug tells you. but the
                        one thing i did very well was foster relationships with
                        my students and guide them through the next step in
                        their lives after high school. talking with my students
                        and learning about their hopes and dreams and goals and
                        wishes was the best part of any day. now, as an
                        engineer, i use that skill and mentor as many people as
                        i can, especially those who are transitioning into
                        technology in a non-traditional way. diversity, equity,
                        inclusion, and belonging is also a passion of mine. as
                        someone who doesn't always look like what one would
                        picture when thinking "engineer," i care so incredibly
                        much about building diverse teams with even more diverse
                        voices, fighting for equity in the workplace, and trying
                        to foster the most welcoming culture i can to make sure
                        everyone feels comfortable and that they belong.

                    <h3>where i'm headed</h3>
                    <p>
                        my dream has always been to work in professional sports. more than the wins and losses, it’s about what sports do for a city — the way they bring people together, create pride, and give people something bigger than themselves to believe in. i’ve seen that especially with detroit. the lions aren’t just a team here; they’re a symbol of grit and resilience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i want to be part of that world, not just as a fan in the stands but as someone contributing behind the scenes. for me, it’s about finding a career where i can combine what i’m good at — problem-solving, learning fast, keeping things running smoothly — with something i love. i want my work to matter to the community around me, and i can’t think of a better way than through sports. and as more women step into roles across professional sports, i want to be part of that movement — opening doors, challenging assumptions, and helping make the industry more inclusive for the next generation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>outside of work</h3>
                    <p>
                        i am originally from toledo, ohio. i know, i know, ohio
                        is the butt of a lot of jokes, but give me five minutes
                        to talk to you about cincinnati (go bearcats!) and i
                        think i'll change your mind. i moved to detroit after
                        college to teach and have stayed in the mitten ever
                        since. my fiancé and i built our dream house
                        in ann arbor (go blue, etc. etc.). if i'm not building
                        stuff and things, i am collecting another cookbook,
                        scrolling through tiktok, at a Lions game,obsessing over my perfect cat,
                        and trying to convince my fiancé to play catch with me.
