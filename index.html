                        my path here
                    </h3>
                    1990s–early 2000s:
grows up in toledo, ohio. develops personality despite this.

college:
discovers writing, rowing, and the invigorating feeling of academic deadlines whooshing by.

post-grad:
moves to detroit to teach high school english. learns how to lead classrooms, navigate teenage emotions, and hype students up for college apps.

after teaching:
dips into financial services. accidentally discovers she loves tech via an internal bootcamp. becomes a software engineer.

software engineer era:
builds dashboards, systems, tools. becomes Very Good At Troubleshooting. burns out spectacularly. decides to breathe, reset, and rethink everything.

the break:
reconnects with creativity, mentoring, sports, and community. starts feeling like herself again.

2024–2025:
applies to grad school. gets in. cries happy tears. begins the pivot toward professional sports.

now:
balancing grad school, lions fandom, and the thrilling art of figuring out the next dream job in sports operations.

future:
nfl or collegiate athletic department — operations, communications, administration, or something equally behind-the-scenes and powerful.
also: petting her cat.
