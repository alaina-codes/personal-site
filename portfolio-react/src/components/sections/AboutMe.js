                my path to becoming a software engineer was certainly a bumpy
                one. starting off as an english teacher, i quickly realized the
                classroom wasn't for me (i would not have liked the current
                alaina, who loves all lower case, but we live and we learn). i
                learned so, so,
                <em>so</em> much, but more on that in a bit. after leaving the
                classroom, i became a loan processor. the company i was with
                created a technology bootcamp of sorts that i was a part of, and
                the rest is history.

                i started off in the fin-tech world, but was focused on building
                internal tools for our engineering teams, allowing them to build
                and ship code safely and quickly. then, i transitioned into the
                wonderful world of email marketing, where i am still at today. i
                started out working on projects that helped users onboard onto a
                very robust platform, transitioned into a growth team focused on
                experiments throughout the entire platform to expand
                understanding in the platform and reduce churn, and now i build
                internal tools to help technical support work through very
                challenging problems.

                reflecting on my time in my classroom with my 12th graders, i
                will be honest, i was not the world's best teacher, no matter
                what my coffee mug tells you. but the one thing i did very well
                was foster relationships with my students and guide them through
                the next step in their lives after high school. talking with my
                students and learning about their hopes and dreams and goals and
                wishes was the best part of any day. now, as an engineer, i use
                that skill and mentor as many people as i can, especially those
                who are transitioning into technology in a non-traditional way.
                diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is also a passion of
                mine. as someone who doesn't always look like what one would
                picture when thinking "engineer," i care so incredibly much
                about building diverse teams with even more diverse voices,
                fighting for equity in the workplace, and trying to foster the
                most welcoming culture i can to make sure everyone feels
                comfortable and that they belong.

                i am originally from toledo, ohio. i know, i know, ohio is the
                butt of a lot of jokes, but give me five minutes to talk to you
                about cincinnati (go bearcats!) and i think i'll change your
                mind. i moved to detroit after college to teach and have stayed
                in the mitten ever since. my fiancé and i are now building our
                dream house in ann arbor (go blue, etc. etc.). if i'm not
                building stuff and things, i am collecting another cookbook,
                scrolling through tiktok, obsessing over my perfect cat, and
                trying to convince my fiancé to learn how to play pickleball.
